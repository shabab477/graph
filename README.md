# Project Tour De Dhaka

This is fun project that we came up while thinking on contemplating on how we can use our problem solving knowledge to the task of solving real world problems. The idea we came up with was simple. We all have learned different shortest path algorithms in our "Data structure and Algorithm" courses. So what if we could map out all the bus routes in Dhaka city and help users to know which bus they can take to reach a certain point from their current location. So every intermediary bus route becomes an edge and every stoppage point becomes a node. 

We are using [Sigma.js](http://sigmajs.org/) library to render our graph. We just provide the logic, it is Sigma's job to render the graph. Look into their [API](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/wiki) for better understanding what tools they provide. If you have any problem while working on our project then email me at **shababkarim93@gmail.com** with the subject **Sigma help**.

Now I want to talk about how we can work to improve this project. There are a lot many ways to improve it actually. Some of them are:

* The most important one. We need to have more accurate data. All the data were taken from the file section of [Desperately Seeking Dhaka(DSD)](https://www.facebook.com/notes/desperately-seeking-dhaka-dsd/dhaka-city-bus-services-info/1052233241561656/), a facebook group which has more than 300,000 members. For example, some where in the data set there is "Mohakhali" and "Mohakhali.", so because of that small dot we are getting different results. It is encouraged that the data set is improved first and foremost.

* Secondly, we would love to get data of the price fixture of different routes for different buses. Then we can give a better suggestion for users to take the cheapest bus route to use.

* Finally, we would like you to suggest more and more features, share ideas on what we can do, what sucks in this project and how to make it "unsuck". Suggest it on the issues tab of the Github project.

This project was built during the [Backpack](https://www.facebook.com/travelshopbackpack/) hackathon. Special thanks to those guys for providing us with all the good food and inspiration which worked as fuel for starting this project.
